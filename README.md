## Overview

Hi! Welcome to my Black-Jack video game utilizing aspects of coding with HTML CSS and Javascript. To play fork and clone this repository. After forking and cloning open the home.html file. This will redirect you to a web browser where the home page of my videogame will be displayed.

## How To Play Pt.1
When you start the game, you will be prompted to choose the amount of chips you want to bet to start the game. After choosing the amount you wish to contribute press the "deal" button. The dealer then deals you and himself two cards with one of his cards flipped over.

## How To Play Pt.2
After the cards are distributed, you can see your score on the left hand side. The point of the game is to beat the dealer by having a higher score, all the while not going over the score of 21. If you go over the score of 21 it is a bust, meaning you automatically are out for the round. Once the cards are dealt, you have an option to either stand (meaning keep the cards you currently have), or hit (add another card to your pile). In the case of the example above the player chose to hit and recieved cards totaling to the sum of 20. After getting to 20 the player pressed stand, sealing the score for the round.

## How To Play Pt.3
The dealer then flips over the card that was hidden in the beginnning of the game and the total sum was 16. The dealer added another card and ended up getting a bust! This resulted in the player winning the round. After the game ends you're prompted to go back to the home screen or play another round.

## That's it. Enjoy the game!!!
