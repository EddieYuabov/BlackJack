## Overview

Hi! Welcome to my Black-Jack video game utilizing aspects of coding with HTML CSS and Javascript. To play fork and clone this repository. After forking and cloning open the home.html file. This will redirect you to a web browser where the home page of my videogame will be displayed.

## How To Play Pt.1
The rules to Black-Jack are very simple. When you start the game you will be prompted to choose the amount of chips you want to bet to start the game. After choosing the amount you wish to contribute press the "deal" button. The dealer then deals you two cards as well as two for himself with one flipped over.

## How To Play Pt.2
After the cards are distributed, you can see your score on the left hand side. The point of the game is to beat the dealer by having a higher score, all the while not going over the score of 21. If you go over the score of 21 it is a bust, meaning you automatically are out for the round. Once being dealt the cards you have an option to either stand (meaning keep the cards you currently have), or Hit (add another card to your pile). In the case of the example above the plaer chose to hit and recieved cards totaling to the sum of 20. After getting to 20 the player pressed stand, sealing the sum as his score for the round.

## How To Play Pt.3
The dealer flipped over the card that was hidden in the beginnning of the game and the total sum was 16. Deciding to push their luck, the dealer added another card and ended up getting a bust! This resulted in the player winning the round, granting him the amount of chips he put into the game and the same amount on top. After the game ended youre prompted to go back to the home screen or play again and try your luck. 

## Thats about it enjoy the game!!!
