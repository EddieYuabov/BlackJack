As of now, Iâ€™m still working on the layout of how the game is going to be. Im thinking of making everything in the center instead of circular like a traditional blackjack board. Nice. Simple. Easier for me to make :) For now theres no functionality in the game but hopefully by the end of Monday that'll change!
